jclouds
======

Apache jclouds is an open source multi-cloud toolkit for the Java platform that gives you the freedom to create applications that are portable across clouds while giving you full control to use cloud-specific features.

For more information about using or contributing to jclouds, please visit our website at [jclouds.apache.org](http://jclouds.apache.org/).

**Note**. This fork contains a set of hot-fixes required for a correct work of [AI DIAL Core](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core/pull/719). We don't support APIs which AI DIAL Core doesn't use.
